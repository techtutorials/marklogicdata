  <extract>Distillation is the process of separating the components or substances from a liquid mixture by using selective boiling and condensation. Distillation may result in essentially complete separation, or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components in the mixture. In either case, the process exploits differences in the relative volatility of the mixture&#x27;s components. In industrial chemistry, distillation is a unit operation of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process, not a chemical reaction. Distillation can also be used to separate a solution made of two or more liquids or fractions, they are called miscible liquids and they must have different boiling points, for example, ethanol and water or fermented fruit juice. a condenser is used a mixture is heated to just over 80 degrees Celsius the ethanol will evaporate and is condensed. It can be collected in a beaker. The water remains in the flask.</extract>
